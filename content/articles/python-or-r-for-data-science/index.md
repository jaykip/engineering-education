The world is moving more and more towards data-driven approaches and solutions. Thus, it is imperative to make data science accessible and understandable to a larger audience beyond software engineers and data scientists.

Developers are making systems with predictive and analytical capabilities targeted towards this course. They are using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming languages to make this happen. But the big question is, why should you choose one of these two data science programming languages over the other?

This article answers this question by comparing Python and R while highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. It also guides you on what circumstances that might require you to use R or Python.

### Python vs. R: popularity statistics

[TIOBE index ranked](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) Python as the third and R as the twelfth most popular programming language in July 2021.

[IEEE Spectrum ranked](https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2020) Python as the number one programming language and R as number six in 2020. It also ranks Python as the fastest growing language and R the fifteenth.

While these statistics place Python as a more popular language among the tech community, it does not necessarily mean that R is an inferior language. These statistics suggest that Python is more widely used and may have a more active community that provides the necessary support.

### Comparing Python and R

Python and R are two widely accepted data science programming languages. The two open-source languages are bringing machine learning, data-driven innovation, and artificial intelligence to life.

For an introduction to R, read [this article](/engineering-education/introduction-to-r/).

We will compare the two languages in terms of the following metrics:

- Ecosystem
- Ease of learning
- Data handling capabilities
- Integrated Development Environment
- Data Collection
- Data Visualization

#### Ecosystem

R has a robust ecosystem composed of cutting-edge user interface packages that communicate between open-source programming languages. Such an ecosystem is helpful to data analysts since it allows them to string their workflows together.

R software and libraries are available at [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes), and Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)). A package is a collection of R compiled code, functions, and data.

Python's ecosystem is considered one of the most user-friendly programming language ecosystems. This is augmented by a simple programming syntax and a syntactically easy to type, and easily interpretable Python code. Python is the to-go tool for building machine learning products and data science pipelines integrable with the web at scale.

Python software and all its libraries are available at [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and Python Package Index ([PyPi](https://pypi.org/)) repositories.

#### Ease of learning

Python is very friendly to learn for complete beginners in programming. It is a language focused on code readability and simplicity. This makes Python a smooth and relatively linear learning curve. Most data science enthusiasts find Python easy to understand and work with on data science projects. With Python notebooks becoming more and more mainstream, the documentation and sharing experience is expected to improve.

The learning curve for R is steep for those with no or less experience in programming. The learning curve becomes steeper as you delve deeper into more complex concepts. For those familiar with programming, learning becomes more manageable when they get a grip of the language.

#### Data handling capabilities

R has several packages such as [Stata](https://www.stata.com/), [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html), and [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/spss-statistics-software), making it convenient for data analysis. With R, you reap the advantage of using formulas and readily usable tests. You do not need to install additional packages to perform data analysis tasks.

Older versions of Python packages for data analysis were not that impressive. But the addition of [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) brought a whole new experience to data analysis in Python. Now, Python is a tool of choice when you need to perform parallel computations.

#### Integrated development environment

An integrated development environment is a software consisting of at least a debugger, build automation tools and a source code editor. These facilities allow computer programmers to develop software applications.

Python offers various IDEs and code editors to choose from, including [Thonny](https://thonny.org/), [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/ide-python), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), and PyCharm. Jupyter Notebook is also available in R, but [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is the most used IDE in R. RStudio is available in [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) format running as a regular desktop app and RStudio Server accessible through the web browser.

#### Data collection

R allows importation of data from text, comma-separated value ([CSV](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/csv.htm)), and Excel files. You can also convert files built in SPSS format and [Minitab](https://www.minitab.com/) into R DataFrames. Modern R packages such as [Rvest](https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/) perform basic web scraping.

Python is praised for its versatility in pulling data from the web. The requests library in Python supports data scraping from the web, which you can use to build datasets. It also allows direct importation of SQL tables into the Python code. Python supports web-sourced JSON file format comma-separated value (CSV) and all other kinds of data formats.

#### Data visualization

Both R and Python provide plotting libraries that allow data scientists to plot charts and graphs for efficient data presentation.

R offers a collection of data visualization libraries, but [ggplot](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.3.5/topics/ggplot) is the most practical of all in terms of usage. The ggplot library's functionality is based on the original [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). The library banks on a [grammar of graphics](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-grammar-of-graphics-for-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-1f92b4ed4149) philosophy and layers to provide an excellent experience for drawing objects on plots. With these layers interconnected with each other, sharing of common features is straightforward. You only need a few code lines to create complex plots. The library allows you to plot a summary of functions.

Python offers several libraries for visualizations and plotting. [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [bokeh](https://bokeh.org/), and [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html) are the most popular libraries. Matplotlib has similar styles and features as [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). In fact, this library is adapted from MATLAB. It is a powerful data visualization tool with in-built functionality, and this makes it easier to make simple plots.

- When you need to incorporate your statistics code into the production database.
- When you want to integrate your data analytics tasks with web applications.

### When to use R

- When dealing with exploratory work. You can perform almost any type of data analysis with R. This tool is rich in packages and contains readily usable tests that make your experimental work easier.
- When data analysis projects require analysis on individual servers and/or standalone computing.

### Conclusion

Both Python and R have their respective strengths that help you complete your data science projects. The decision on which of the two languages to choose depends on your statistical analysis or deployment needs.
